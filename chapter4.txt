The two boys lied together in bed.
Nat leaned over to the nightstand and shut off the lamp.
The only light that came into the room now was the moon's.
Nat turned his gaze to Shiggy, and held his hand.
"What do you feel?" Nat asked.
"I guess I'm...scared?"
"Why are you scared? Is it too dark? Want me to turn the lamp back on?"
"No!" Shiggy yelled. "I mean I'm just...I don't know."
Nat interlocked his fingers with Shiggy which prompted the latter to look at him.
"It's fine if you don't wanna do it, Shiggy. I'm not forcing you."
"I do want to do it. Especially with you, Nat. I just feel like I won't be good at...that."
"What do you mean?"
"That I'm scared I can't satisfy you."
A silence came between them for a few moments. Shiggy wrapped his arms around himself.
"I feel the same." Nat's voice was softer than usual. Shiggy's interest peaked, his eyes focused on Nat's. Nat took Shiggy's hand again.
"I'm scared of that too. I don't want to feel like I failed you. But even if it isn't the best, we could always try again, right?"
Shiggy felt tears begin to fall down his cheeks.
He smiles at Nat, and nods.
"Yeah, we can always try again."
