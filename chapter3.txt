The winter snow fell with increasing fervor.
Shiggy only stared in awe at the winter wonderland that lay just outside Belchero Orphanage.
Nat brushed up against Shiggy's side.
Shiggy looked over at Nat, his eyes softening at the sight of his best friend.
Nat handed him a cup of hot cocoa.
Milk was poured in the shape of a heart.
Shiggy gave a playful "Awe." at Nat who responded with a gentle but ticklish kiss to his neck.
